# Mandelbrot-Variations
Various versions of code to produce different forms of mandelbrot sets using different techniques.

________________________

There are 4 sub-projects.

1) Mandelrot Set: This produces a regular mandelbrot fractal as a bitmap image.
2) Threaded 4d Mandlebrot Set: This produces a 2d slice of a 4d Mandelbrot fractal as a bitmap image. This code uses basic multithreading in an attempt to increase speed.
3) Threaded Mandelbrot Set: This produces a regular mandelbrot fractal as a bitmap image. This code uses basic multithreading in an attempt to increase speed.
4) Threaded Multibrot Set: This iterates through mandelbrot fractals using a varying power to show how the fractal changes. Several bitmap images are produced with titles corresponding to their powers.

Note several typos in the names of the sub-projects. These have been retained as I find the fact I misspelled Mandelbrot twice in different ways to be quite funny.
